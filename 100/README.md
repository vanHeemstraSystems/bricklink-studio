# 100 - Introduction

Hello lego fans and creators welcome back to boon builds for my tutorial on bricklink studio.

Bricklink studio is a digital building platform. It's like a 3d cad for building lego on your computer. Of all the digital lego building platforms available bricklink studio is certainly my favorite. I've been using it since it first came out and in this series of tutorials I'm going to show you how to get the most out of it. 

This video is intended to be the very first tutorial in my series so this video is for people who are new to studio whether you are brand new to virtual 3d digital lego building or if you are migrating to studio from another platform like ldd. 

In this video I'll show you how to download and install studio I'll also give you an overview of all the tools and the menus and the features that you need to know about to get diving into building digitally in bricklink studio. 

If you're already using studio and you're looking for tutorials on more specific topics or advanced techniques please check out the links in the description of this video and watch the tutorials in my [bricklink studio tutorial playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJLUP5dbMVzwfEPjK_4WIas_hiW9xIbCi).
