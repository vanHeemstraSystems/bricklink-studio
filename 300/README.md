Based on "Top 10 BRICKLINK STUD.IO tips you should know! (Tutorial)" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR3CLZ0rxSo

every time you open studio you will see this launch window right in the center of your screen i see three of my models here because i've viewed them recently there are a number of other items we can get into in future tutorials on this screen but first we're just going to click create new and dive into building let's talk a little bit about the mouse controls using your right mouse button to click and drag allows you to look at the 3d space from different angles using the scroll wheel zooms in and out and your left click allows you to select and place elements alright so let's just dive right in and place something we'll pull this one by one brick here after placing that brick it immediately gives me a second one i can choose to place that or i can press escape or delete on my keyboard to release it now i'll select a 1 by 2 brick and rotate it using the arrow keys on my keyboard you can see left and right turn it side to side in either direction up and down arrow keys turn it to the back or to the front in case you wanted a sideways brick using the arrow keys on your keyboard you can turn your pieces in pretty much any direction in increments of 90 degrees now let's go ahead and take a look at the parts palette on the left hand side of your screen the very top shows which set of parts you're using i typically use the master parts list there are some other reasons you might want to use different parts palettes we'll get to that in future tutorials directly beneath there you have some categories you can scroll through these categories and let's say we want to select something in the cylinder category click there and we'll see all of the available cylinder pieces directly beneath the categories list is the search bar i tend to use the search bar much more often than the category list i'll show you a little bit about that in a moment but the category list can be really helpful if you're looking for something and you can picture it in your head but you don't know what it's called you might be able to find it by looking at some of the clues in the category list all right down here in the search bar let's say i wanted a two by six brick i can just start typing two by six and it's going to start pointing me in the right direction now i can place my 2x6 brick in the building area directly to the right of the search bar we have color options you can select a color if you want to start searching by color you're going to see the parts in those colors you can even check this hide unavailable colors so if i want to build in blue i've searched two by six it's going to give me every part that has ever existed in that color of course if i uncheck hide unavailable colors it's going to take a moment take a look at the database and then it's going to show me all of the applicable parts in that color whether they existed in that color or not that can be helpful if you want to build something that you can actually go get the parts for right okay next to that we've got a button that toggles on and off printed bricks so here you see in my search criteria all of the printed bricks that are available i don't tend to build with that function on very often unless i know that there's a specific printed brick that i want to look for and include in my creation the icon on the right changes the size of your parts previews and the parts palette this might be helpful if you're looking through a lot of parts or if you want to make them a little bit bigger and easier to see across the screen on the right side we have a color palette this drop down shows you all of the available colors i'm going to select this 2x6 brick and in the color palette drop down with hide unavailable colors selected you can see we are only getting the colors that this element is available in the dollar signs on the right hand give you a relative idea of how much that part costs in that color as related to the price of that part in other colors if i uncheck hide unavailable colors now
 
i can choose from all the lego colors whether that part has been produced in that color or not and if i stumble across one that that part has never been produced in you'll see below the color palette a parts list that will show a little yellow exclamation point if that part has never been produced in that color i can hover over the exclamation point and it shows me what the problem is says color unavailable all right i'll switch that back to yellow in content colors we can see the colors that exist in the creation you can
 
easily click on one of those existing colors and turn the brick back to that color i'm going to zoom out just a little bit here and by clicking and dragging across the screen i can select as many bricks as i want to now so far i have been using just the basic select tool you can see that at the top left of your screen here you can also use the select tool at any time by clicking v if you click on the little arrow by the select tool you get some other options i'll get into that in other tutorials but for right now we can just use this
default select tool i'd say the next most commonly used tool from the toolbar is the clone tool you can see it's the third one on the list here you can also select the clone tool at any time by clicking c on your keyboard with the clone tool active when you click on a brick it automatically clones that brick and lets you place it somewhere else this will keep cloning and cloning until you press escape or delete on your keyboard now i'm going to delete just a couple of these away and we'll see a
 
little bit of action here when i bring this toward another brick it starts giving me options of where to place that brick that's because the snap tool is selected in the toolbar if i unclick snap you can see it just sort of floats around out there there are times when you might want to have snap off but i almost always build with snap on makes it pretty easy to put things in just the way they would go in real life another tool that you might use fairly frequently is hinge i'm gonna click these together by just one stud this
 
wouldn't really work in the real world but it'll give us a good example for using the hinge tool the hinge tool is the second tool on the toolbar you can click there or press h on your keyboard at any time to activate the hinge tool with the hinge tool i can click on this brick and it gives me there's just one point of articulation between these two bricks and now you see i can select that and start to turn that brick on that stud the hinge tool works with anything that can be hinged i'm going to go ahead
 
and search for hinge in the search bar and uh let's see maybe i will bring over one of these types of hinge bricks and one of these rotating and it will snap to the other hinge there now when i select the hinge tool i can click on the brick that i want to hinge and move it into position now let's say i'm building and i decide i want to get rid of a handful of the elements that i've placed i can press control on my keyboard and click to select multiple items and delete those items or i can move those items around as a
 
unit i just noticed over here in the parts list i've got a couple of exclamation points which means that these hinge bricks do not come in blue so i can click on this brick come up here click hide unavailable colors and you'll see i can select dark bluish gray for that one click on the other hinge and we've got a few more options i'll change that one to tan and now you see we've eliminated all of the errors in our parts list now i'm going to hit ctrl a on my keyboard or command a to select all of
 
the items pressing delete to get rid of it i'm going to build a little model of a brick and i'll just talk to you about what i'm doing as i go i think i want this brick to be mostly yellow so i'm going to go to the parts palette color selector click on the yellow family and go down to yellow and i do want to go ahead and hide unavailable colors so that i'm not building with any parts that don't actually exist this is going to be a large scale 2x2 brick so i'm going to start with let's say like a 6x6
 
and you can see that came up there pretty quickly but if i wanted to filter this even further i can start typing plate and you see there i get played good and if i wanted a round plate i could type round and it's just gonna keep filtering for the more keywords that i give it there okay but this six by six plate is the one i want go like this now i want this to be like a little box so i'm going to build with some bricks around and i'll do a one by four here and here and a one by six and again the default feature when
 
pulling an item out of the parts palette is that once you place it you essentially have the clone tool and you get to place that item as many times as you want until you press escape or delete sometimes you might find that it's difficult to place the brick exactly where you want it depending on the view so even with a part in your selection you can right click and drag to change the view of your model and then you can get your parts placed all right now i'm going to add another layer of this but i want to overlap my
 
seams so i'm going to click on these four and i can press c which is the clone tool it's going to clone all four of those and i'm going to press the left arrow to rotate that 90 degrees and now i can set that layer on top of that layer now i want to cap these walls off with some tile so i'll type tile into my search let's see i'll go ahead and place 1 by 6's across and i think next i want one of those 1 by 4 plates that has a stud at each end let's see there they are right there
 
put one right here and one right there just a few studs for the lid of this box to sit on then i'll select the bottom plate click c on my keyboard that's the clone tool stick that to the top now i want mostly to tile this out up top so we'll go back to tiles and we'll do a one by six one by six and how about a one by four and then maybe i'll take these two by two l-shaped tiles [Music] put them here now i just want four studs on there that i can build up the larger scale studs do plate and the very first plate should
 
be one by one pretty much all of these parts in the parts palette in these categories increase by size so you're going to start generally speaking with the smallest items at the top of the list scroll down to find the larger items i'm going to stud in there now i want some round plates so i'll do round plate that will get me this far i can look at this piece is that the one that has yep it's got an anti-stud right in the center of the bottom so i'm gonna place this on top of those studs then i can do round
 
tile and now i have built a scale replica of a 2x2 brick let's say i had built many of these and i want to zoom in and look at one i can press my scroll button the center button on the mouse and click and drag and that allows me to pan the view of the build without rotating it around so the right click rotates that center scroll button when you click lets you pan back and forth scrolling the scroller lets you zoom in and out so i'll pan into one of these and when i rotate you can see i'm rotating around
 
this brick if i pan over to this brick you see it the rotation seems to be a little wonky that means my origin is still over there on that left brick and i want to place it here i can click on this piece right click and click set as origin and now when i rotate i get a little bit more control over rotating around what i really want to focus on right clicking on any piece gives you some other options we'll get into some more of these in other tutorials but with this part selected we also see some other information down
 
here at the bottom the one i want to focus on right now is price this gives you an estimate of the price for that element there are a lot of factors that go into that and we can discuss that in further detail in the future but that just gives you a basic idea this says this 6x6 plate in yellow is going to be a dollar 28 on bricklink i might change it to a different color and let's see blue you can see blue is only 20 cents in the united states dollars most of the time when i'm building digitally i know i want to order these
 
parts to build it in real life so i tend to watch the price of my pieces as i lay them sometimes an expensive part might cause me to change the color or rethink whether there's another part that i can use another way that you can change the view of your model besides using your mouse is in this camera view here on the far left we have perspective that basically gives you a perspective view of the model something similar to what you would expect to see in real life on the far right we've got orthographic
 
that means there's no perspective on the model you're seeing this very linear mathematical view of a three-dimensional object by clicking any of the icons in the middle you see the front the back the right side the left side you can see the model from the bottom and you can see the model from the top these views can help in a lot of different scenarios if you want to make sure things are in just the right place now the last studio feature i want to discuss in this video is collision you can see the collision icon in the center
 
of your toolbar at the top of the screen i have had collision enabled throughout this tutorial which does not allow two items to be placed in conflicting space if i turn this function off i now have the ability to make items collide in a way that they wouldn't in real life let me show you so if i click c on my keyboard for the clone tool i'm gonna clone one of these two by six bricks and i can start to find places to put it where it will think there's a stud there it's connecting to the studs on that bottom
 
plate and if i click it it is now existing in space that can't really be shared in real life with this one by four that goes across there are some very unique situations where you might want to be able to make items collide for the most part i build with the collision function enabled because i don't want to build something digitally that i can't build in the real world there are a few exceptions but we'll talk about those in a future tutorial this is it for my introductory tutorial for bricklink studio if you liked this
 
video please hit that thumbs up button if you have any specific questions about studio or any topics you'd like to see in a future tutorial please put those ideas in the comments section below this video and i'll be happy to get to them as soon as possible if you want to see more like these please subscribe to boone builds and hit that bell icon so you get notified when i publish videos in the future thank you so much for watching i hope you have a lot of fun with brickling studio and until next time go build
 
something amazing [Music]
